/**1051. Height Checker
 * Students are asked to stand in non-decreasing order of heights for an annual photo.
 * 
 * Return the minimum number of students that must move in order for all students to be standing in non-decreasing order of height.
 * 
 * Notice that when a group of students is selected they can reorder in any possible way between themselves and the non selected students remain on their seats.
 * 
 *  
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: 
 * Current array : [1,1,4,2,1,3]
 * Target array  : [1,1,1,2,3,4]
 * On index 2 (0-based) we have 4 vs 1 so we have to move this student.
 * On index 4 (0-based) we have 1 vs 3 so we have to move this student.
 * On index 5 (0-based) we have 3 vs 4 so we have to move this student.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: heights = [5,1,2,3,4]
 * Output: 5
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * Input: heights = [1,2,3,4,5]
 * Output: 0
 *

// okay, so the .sort()
//  takes a function with params (a, b) and returns either a positive or negative num then switches the indexes
// also it sorts that array!. so I cannot compare sorted and heights. they are the same thing... 
// so I have to make a copy, but without the .slice(0,len) function it is just a pointer,
// a reference to heights, therefore when it gets sorted on line 85 it is still "looking" 
// at itself
